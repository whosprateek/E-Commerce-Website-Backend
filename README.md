# E-commerce API

---

## üìú Introduction

This is the backend API for a comprehensive E-commerce application. It handles all server-side logic, including product management, user authentication, and shopping cart operations. The API is built with a modern JavaScript stack, featuring Node.js and Express, and it leverages MongoDB for data persistence.

Key functionalities include secure endpoints via JWT, middleware for logging requests, CORS configuration for accommodating client applications, and detailed API documentation through Swagger.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user signup and signin functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticating subsequent requests.
* **Product Management:** Complete CRUD operations for products, allowing sellers to manage their inventory. Users can also filter and rate products.
* **Shopping Cart:** Functionality for users to add, view, and remove items from their shopping cart.
* **API Security:** Endpoints for products and cart items are protected and can only be accessed with a valid JWT.
* **API Documentation:** Interactive API documentation is available through Swagger UI at the `/api-docs` endpoint.
* **Logging:** A logger middleware is implemented to record all incoming requests with their payloads, which is useful for debugging and monitoring.
* **Error Handling:** A centralized error handling mechanism is in place to manage application-specific and server errors gracefully.
* **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled to allow requests from specified origins.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
